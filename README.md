# Exploratory_data_analysis

# Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical graphics and visualization tools.The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present findings using visualizations that support business decision-making.

# Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook


# Key Steps in the EDA

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**
2. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Shape, data types, missing values
   - Summary statistics
3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing/null values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Encoding categorical variables
4. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of numerical and categorical features
5. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Pair plots, group comparisons
6. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots, IQR, Z-score method
7. **Visualization of Trends and Patterns**
8. **Insights and Observations**


#  Sample Visualizations

- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE)
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Bar plots for categorical analysis


## Conclusion

The EDA process helped uncover important aspects of the dataset that can guide further modeling or business decisions. These insights can support stakeholder discussions, feature engineering for ML, or data-driven strategic planning.
